# Boombox Volume Adjuster
A mod that lets you adjust the volume of the boombox, especially useful with custom songs.

## Installation
```
- Install BepinEx.
- Place BepInEx/plugins/BoomboxVolumeAdjuster.dll in your BepInEx/plugins folder.
```

## How to use
After launching the game, open BepInEx/config/yvex.boomboxVolumeAdjuster.cfg and change the volume's value.</br >
The default value is 100 (Max).

If you have any performance issue, it might be helpful to set "Dont Update After Start" to true. This will require a game restart every time you want to change the boombox's volume.
